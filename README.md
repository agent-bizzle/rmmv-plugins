# rmmv-plugins
Testbed/development project for S_Rank_Crazy RPG Maker MV plugins. This exists to ensure compatibility between all S_Rank_Crazy plugins.

This repository also contains all of my original scripts - which may or may not work with each other.

[**legacy**](./legacy) contains my older plugins. Some are old plugins that haven't been revisted, others will eventually be rewritten and added to the testbed. 

[**src**](./src) contains stable, tested versions of the plugins.

[**testbed**](./testbed) contains the RPG Maker MV project for test/demo purposes.
