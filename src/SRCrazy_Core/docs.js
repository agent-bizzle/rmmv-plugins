 *                       S_Rank_Crazy's Core Plugin
 * ============================================================================
 * This plugin provides some useful functions to be used by other plugins or by
 * events (if applicable).
 *
 * This plugin should be placed above most other SRCrazy plugins in the Plugin
 * Manager. If you're using the MVCommons or PluginManagement plugins then
 * any dependency issues will be output as errors when the game loads.
 *
 * All SRCrazy plugins are rename safe - you can rename the file and it'll still
 * work. All parameters and commands are case-safe (no need to worry about
 * case-sensitive input) unless specifically stated. This doesn't include
 * Comment Tags or file names/paths; they are still case sensitive.
 *
 * MVCommons supported but not required for use.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * TERMS OF USE
 *
 * Free for commercial and non-commercial use. No credit need be given, but
 * always appreciated.
 *
 * ============================================================================
